cd sipfire-gateway

# Build the project
cargo build --release

# Install binaries
cargo install --path .
```

### Using Cargo

  -p 5060:5060/udp \
  redfire/redfire-gateway:latest
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Configuration

Create a configuration file at `/etc/redfire/gateway.toml`:

```toml
[general]
node_id = "redfire-gateway-1"
description = "Primary TDMoE Gateway"
max_calls = 1000
call_timeout = 300

[tdmoe]
interface = "eth0"
channels = 30
mtu = 1500
qos_dscp = 46

[sip]
listen_port = 5060
domain = "gateway.example.com"
transport = "udp"
max_sessions = 500

[rtp]
port_range = { min = 10000, max = 20000 }
jitter_buffer_size = 50

[b2bua]
enabled = true
max_concurrent_calls = 500
enable_codec_transcoding = false  # Set to true with external library
transcoding_backend = "auto"      # cpu, simd, simd-avx2, simd-avx512, cuda, rocm, gpu, auto

# SIMD acceleration settings for high-performance codec transcoding
enable_simd = true
auto_detect_simd = true          # Auto-detect best available SIMD instruction set
simd_fallback = true            # Fallback to CPU if SIMD fails

[logging]
level = "info"
file = "/var/log/redfire-gateway.log"
format = "json"
```

### Environment Variables

Configuration can also be provided via environment variables:

```bash
export REDFIRE_GENERAL_NODE_ID="gateway-01"
export REDFIRE_SIP_LISTEN_PORT=5060
export REDFIRE_LOGGING_LEVEL="debug"
```

See [examples/](examples/) directory for complete configuration examples.

### SIMD Acceleration Configuration

Redfire Gateway includes SIMD-optimized codec transcoding using x86-64 assembly language for maximum performance:

```toml
[b2bua]
enable_codec_transcoding = true
transcoding_backend = "simd-avx2"   # Force specific SIMD instruction set

# SIMD configuration options
enable_simd = true
simd_instruction_set = "avx2"       # "auto", "sse", "avx2", "avx512"
auto_detect_simd = false            # Set to true for runtime detection
simd_fallback = true               # Fallback to CPU if SIMD fails
```

**Supported SIMD instruction sets:**
- **SSE**: Basic SIMD support (legacy systems)
- **AVX2**: Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (recommended for modern x86-64)
- **AVX-512**: Latest vector extensions (high-end processors)
- **Auto**: Runtime detection of best available instruction set

**Performance gains with SIMD:**
- **2-4x faster** codec transcoding compared to scalar CPU
- **Lower latency** for real-time voice processing
- **Reduced CPU usage** for high call volumes
